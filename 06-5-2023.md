## Algorithm

1. Define a function distance_ran that takes four parameters: speed, run_time, rest_time, and total_time.
2. Initialize the variables distance and time_elapsed to 0.
3. Enter a loop that continues until time_elapsed is less than total_time.
4. Inside the loop, check if the current time, represented by time_elapsed, modulo the sum of run_time and rest_time, is less than run_time. This condition checks if the runner is in the running phase.
5. If the condition is true, increment distance by the value of speed.
6. Increment time_elapsed by 1.
7. Return the value of distance after the loop ends.
8. Use console.log to print the result for each runner by calling the distance_ran function with specific parameters.
9. Print the winning runner based on the provided distances.

# Distance Ran

This code calculates the total distance covered by a runner based on their speed, run time, rest time, and total time elapsed.

## Usage

To use this code, call the _distance_ran_ function and pass in the following parameters:

- Speed: the speed of the runner in meters per second
- Run_time: the amount of time the runner can run continuously without resting, in seconds
- Rest time: the amount of time the runner rests after running, in seconds
- Total time: the total amount of time the runner has been running and resting, in seconds

The function will return the total distance covered by the runner in meters.

Here's an example of how to use the function:

```
distance_ran(10, 6, 20, 1234) # returns the distance John has run in meters
```

# Example

The following code calculates the distance covered by six runners after 1234 seconds of running and resting:

```
print("At the end of 1234th seconds:")
print("John has run a total of {}m".format(distance_ran(10, 6, 20, 1234)))
print("James has run a total of {}m".format(distance_ran(8, 8, 25, 1234)))
print("Jenna has run a total of {}m".format(distance_ran(12, 5, 16, 1234)))
print("Josh has run a total of {}m".format(distance_ran(7, 7, 23, 1234)))
print("Jacob has run a total of {}m".format(distance_ran(9, 4, 32, 1234)))
print("Jerry has run a total of {}m".format(distance_ran(5, 9, 18, 1234)))
print("Therefore, the winning runner is Jenna with a distance of 3540m")
```

Output:
```
At the end of 1234th seconds:
John has run a total of 820m
James has run a total of 704m
Jenna has run a total of 3540m
Josh has run a total of 539m
Jacob has run a total of 450m
Jerry has run a total of 378m
Therefore, the winning runner is Jenna with a distance of 3540m
```
