# Algorithm

1. Define two constants, ROWS and COLS, to represent the dimensions of the layout.
2. Create a function called print_layout that prints the current layout.
3. Create a function called next_minute_layout that calculates the layout for the next minute based on the game rules.
4. Implement the main function as follows:
Declare and initialize an array called start_state with the initial layout.
Print the start state using the print_layout function.
Declare and initialize an array called layouts to store encountered layouts.
Declare and initialize a variable called minute to 1 to keep track of the number of minutes passed.
Declare and initialize a variable called layouts_count to 1 to track the number of layouts stored.
Copy the start_state to the first element of the layouts array.
Declare and initialize a variable called lifeform_score to 0 to keep track of the total lifeform score.
Enter an infinite loop:
Create a new array called new_layout to store the layout for the next minute.
Calculate the next layout using the next_minute_layout function with the previous layout.
Check if the next layout has been encountered before by comparing it with previously stored layouts.
If the next layout is repeated:
Set a flag called repeated to 1.
Print the minute and the repeated layout using the print_layout function.
Calculate the lifeform score by iterating over each element of the repeated layout:
If the element is 'X', calculate the tile number and value using the row and column indices and a power function.
Add the tile value to the lifeform_score.
Break out of the loop.
If the next layout is not repeated:
Copy the next layout to the layouts array at the current index (layouts_count).
Print the minute and the next layout using the print_layout function.
Increment the minute and layouts_count by 1.
Print the lifeform_score for the first layout that appears twice.
Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
