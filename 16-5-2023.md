# Question

What is the score?

In this final puzzle, we bring you to Mars. That’s right - you’re an astronaut now. As part of
the expedition, you’re required to look for lifeforms on the planet. You pull up your scanner,
and scan scan scan.

Unexpectedly, your sensor starts picking up things! However, your space budget didn’t quite
cover scientific equipment and you'll have to make do with its abilities. The sensor scans an
area that fits into a 5x5 grid. The scan shows lifeforms (X), and empty spaces (.)

That’s strange. Your sensor changes quite rapidly - turns out at each minute new lifeforms
appear and existing ones die. After a while, you make the following observation:

1. At each minute, lifeforms live and die based on the number of lifeforms in the four
adjacent tiles. For reference, this is what the adjacent tiles look like (.) based on one lifeform
(X)

 .
.X.
 .

 2. A lifeform passes away, and is replaced by an empty space UNLESS there is EXACTLY
one lifeform adjacent to it.

3. An empty space becomes filled with a lifeform if exactly ONE or TWO lifeforms are
adjacent to it. Otherwise, the lifeform or the empty space remains the same

Taking rules 2 and 3, we observe the following after one minute:

 .           X
.X. becomes X.X
 .           X

 4. How about the tiles on the edge of the grid? They are considered to have fewer than 4
adjacent tiles, and the missing tiles count as empty space permanently

5. This process happens at every location simultaneously, i.e. you should count the number
of adjacent lifeforms or space for each lifeform, and then update the tiles

Example

Start state:
....X
X..X.
X..XX
..X..
X....

1 minute:
X..X.
XXXX.
XXX.X
XX.XX
.XX..

1 minute:
X..X.
XXXX.
XXX.X
XX.XX
.XX..

3 minutes:
X....
XXXX.
...XX
X.XX.
.XX.X

4 minutes:
XXXX.
....X
XX..X
.....
XX...

Apart from the rules above, you’re trying to understand what their nature is. You contact HQ,
and HQ says to watch the first time a layout appears twice.

Basically, there will come a time where you will observe the following twice:

.....
.....
.....
X....
.X...

HQ also says to calculate the lifeform score of that layout. Due to some odd configuration in
your communicator, you’ll have to calculate it this way:

2**(the tile number)

Consider each from left to right in the top row as tiles 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and the next row as 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, … , and the last row is 20, 21, 22, 23, 24

..... 0 1 2 3 4
..... 5 6 7 8 9
..... 10 11 12 13 14
X.... 15 16 17 18 19
.X... 20 21 22 23 24

The lifeform score is thus
2**15 (32768) + 2**21 (2097152) = 2129920

Question

Consider the following start state:

XXXX.
X....
X..X.
.X.X.
XX.XX

What is the lifeform score for the first layout that appears twice?

## Answer

The lifeform score for the first layer that appears twice is 32509983


## Algorithm

1. Define two constants, ROWS and COLS, to represent the dimensions of the layout.
2. Create a function called print_layout that prints the current layout.
3. Create a function called next_minute_layout that calculates the layout for the next minute based on the game rules.
4. Implement the main function as follows:

   - Declare and initialize an array called start_state with the initial layout.
   - Print the start state using the print_layout function.
   - Declare and initialize an array called layouts to store encountered layouts.
   - Declare and initialize a variable called minute to 1 to keep track of the number of minutes passed.
   - Declare and initialize a variable called layouts_count to 1 to track the number of layouts stored.
   - Copy the start_state to the first element of the layouts array.
   - Declare and initialize a variable called lifeform_score to 0 to keep track of the total lifeform score.
   - Enter an infinite loop:
       - Create a new array called new_layout to store the layout for the next minute.
       - Calculate the next layout using the next_minute_layout function with the previous layout.
       - Check if the next layout has been encountered before by comparing it with previously stored layouts.
       - If the next layout is repeated:
          - Set a flag called repeated to 1.
          - Print the minute and the repeated layout using the print_layout function.
          - Calculate the lifeform score by iterating over each element of the repeated layout:
             - If the element is 'X', calculate the tile number and value using the row and column indices and a power function.
             - Add the tile value to the lifeform_score.
          - Break out of the loop.
   - If the next layout is not repeated:
          - Copy the next layout to the layouts array at the current index (layouts_count).
          - Print the minute and the next layout using the print_layout function.
          - Increment the minute and layouts_count by 1.
  - Print the lifeform_score for the first layout that appears twice.
  - Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
