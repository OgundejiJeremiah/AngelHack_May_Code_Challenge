# Min Cost

This is a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum cost of removing a worker and re-pairing the remaining workers based on their efficiency. The function also returns the worker that was removed and the paired used to get the minimum cost.

The minimum cost is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the efficiency levels of each pair of workers after the re-pairing.

#   Usage

The **min_cost** function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array containing the minimum cost, the worker that was removed, and the pairs used to get the minimum cost. Here is an example:

```
const efficiency = [1, 3, 54, 712, 52, 904, 113, 12, 135, 32, 31, 56, 23, 79, 611, 123, 677, 232, 997, 101, 111, 123, 2, 7, 24, 57, 99, 45, 666, 42, 104, 129, 554, 335, 876, 35, 15, 93, 13];

const results = min_cost(efficiency);

console.log(`Worker with efficiency ${results[1]} was excluded`);
console.log(`The paired used to get the minimum cost ${JSON.stringify(results[2])}`);
console.log(`The minimum cost of the given array is ${results[0]}`);
```

This will output:

```
Worker with efficiency 997 was excluded
The paired used to get the minimum cost [[1, 2], [3, 7], [12, 13], [15, 23], [24, 31], [32, 35], [42, 45], [52, 54], [56, 57], [79, 93], [99, 101], [104, 111], [123, 123], [129, 135], [232, 335], [554, 611], [666, 677], [712, 876], [904, 997]]
The minimum cost of the given array is 1578
