# Algorithm

1. Start by defining a function minCostOfEfficiencies that takes an array efficiencies as input.
2. Initialize variables n, i, j, cost, remainingCost, and minCost.
* Set n as the length of the efficiencies array.
+ Set i, j, cost, remainingCost, and minCost to undefined.
3. Create a copy of the efficiencies array called remainingEfficiencies using the slice method.
4. Sort the remainingEfficiencies array in ascending order using the sort method with a comparison function (a, b) => a - b.
5. Calculate the number of pairs of adjacent workers by dividing n by 2 and flooring the result. Store it in numPairs.
6. Create an empty array called pairs.
7. Iterate i from 0 to numPairs - 1:
- Assign remainingEfficiencies[2 * i] and remainingEfficiencies[2 * i + 1] as a pair and add it to the pairs array.
8. Initialize cost to 0.
9. Iterate i from 0 to numPairs - 1:
- Calculate the absolute difference between the first and second element of pairs[i].
- Add the absolute difference to cost.
10. Iterate i from 0 to n - 1:
- Assign remainingEfficiencies[i] to excludedEfficiency.
- Create a new array called newRemainingEfficiencies by filtering remainingEfficiencies and excluding the element at index i.
- Calculate the number of pairs in newRemainingEfficiencies by dividing its length by 2 and flooring the result. Store it in numRemainingPairs.
- Create an empty array called remainingPairs.
- Iterate j from 0 to numRemainingPairs - 1:
- Assign newRemainingEfficiencies[2 * j] and newRemainingEfficiencies[2 * j + 1] as a pair and add it to the remainingPairs array.
- Initialize remainingCost to 0.
- Iterate j from 0 to numRemainingPairs - 1:
+ Calculate the absolute difference between the first and second element of remainingPairs[j].
+ Add the absolute difference to remainingCost.
- If remainingCost is less than minCost, update minCost to remainingCost.
11. Return minCost.
12. Define an array called efficiencies with the given values.
13. Call the minCostOfEfficiencies function with efficiencies as the argument and store the result in minCost.
14. Print "Minimum cost of task: " concatenated with minCost to the console.

# Min Cost

This is a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum cost of removing a worker and re-pairing the remaining workers based on their efficiency. The function also returns the worker that was removed and the paired used to get the minimum cost.

The minimum cost is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the efficiency levels of each pair of workers after the re-pairing.

#   Usage

The **min_cost** function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array containing the minimum cost, the worker that was removed, and the pairs used to get the minimum cost. Here is an example:

```
const efficiency = [1, 3, 54, 712, 52, 904, 113, 12, 135, 32, 31, 56, 23, 79, 611, 123, 677, 232, 997, 101, 111, 123, 2, 7, 24, 57, 99, 45, 666, 42, 104, 129, 554, 335, 876, 35, 15, 93, 13];

const results = min_cost(efficiency);

console.log(`Worker with efficiency ${results[1]} was excluded`);
console.log(`The paired used to get the minimum cost ${JSON.stringify(results[2])}`);
console.log(`The minimum cost of the given array is ${results[0]}`);
```

This will output:

```
Worker with efficiency 997 was excluded
The paired used to get the minimum cost [[1, 2], [3, 7], [12, 13], [15, 23], [24, 31], [32, 35], [42, 45], [52, 54], [56, 57], [79, 93], [99, 101], [104, 111], [123, 123], [129, 135], [232, 335], [554, 611], [666, 677], [712, 876], [904, 997]]
The minimum cost of the given array is 1578
