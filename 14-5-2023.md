# Question

How many steps are needed to disconnect the string?

A secure communication network has been compromised and the cyber security team must
restore its security. The network, series, is represented as a series of nodes identified using
lowercase English letters. The nodes must be disconnected in order to remove the threat. In
a single operation, any number of adjacent nodes identified by the same character can be
disconnected. Find the minimum number of operations required to disconnect all the nodes
and secure the network.

Example
Suppose we have a series that goes "aabbaa".

To remove the string entirely, you’d first have to get rid of “bb” to get “aaaa” and then you can
remove “aaaa”.

You can remove the first “aa” to get “bbaa” but it means you’d need to spend another two
moves to remove “bb” and then “aa”.

In this case, the minimum number of moves required to delete the entire series is 2.

Another example
Suppose we have another series that goes “aabbbcccaacccaa”.

What’s the minimum number of moves required for this?

You can remove the middle “aa” first to get “aabbbccccccaa” and then remove “cccccc” to
get “aabbbaa”, and then you remove the “bbb” and subsequently “aaaa” to delete the entire
series.

Boom, 4 moves.

What is the minimum number of steps required to delete this series:

## Answer

The minimum number of steps required to delete this series is 78

# Algorithm

1. Define the function `find_minimum_deletion(l, r, dp, s)`:
- Check the base cases:
- If `l > r`, return 0 since the substring is empty.
- If `l == r`, return 1 since the substring has only one character and it needs to be deleted.
- If `dp[l][r]` is not equal to -1, return the precomputed result stored in `dp[l][r]`.
- Initialize `res` to a large value.
- When a single character is deleted, increment `res` by 1 and call the `find_minimum_deletion` function recursively for the next substring (l + 1 to r).
- Iterate from i = l + 1 to r:
- If `s[l]` is equal to `s[i]`, it means there is a group of consecutive characters that can be deleted if any of them matches.
- Call the find_minimum_deletion function recursively for two substrings:
- From `l + 1 to i - 1`: delete the letters in between `l and i` when both characters are the same.
- From `i to r`: delete the remaining substring after the matched group.
- Calculate the sum of these two recursive calls and update `res` with the minimum value.
- Memoize the result by storing `res` in `dp[l][r]`.
- Return `res`.

2. In the driver code:
- Define the input string `s`.
- Get the length of the string `n`.
- Define the size of the `dp` array as `N` and initialize it with -1 for each element.
- Call the `find_minimum_deletion` function with initial arguments `0` (start index) and `n - 1` (end index), along with `dp` and s as parameters.
- Print the result.
