# Algorithm

1. Define the function `find_minimum_deletion(l, r, dp, s)`:
- Check the base cases:
- If `l > r`, return 0 since the substring is empty.
- If `l == r`, return 1 since the substring has only one character and it needs to be deleted.
- If `dp[l][r]` is not equal to -1, return the precomputed result stored in `dp[l][r]`.
- Initialize `res` to a large value.
- When a single character is deleted, increment `res` by 1 and call the `find_minimum_deletion` function recursively for the next substring (l + 1 to r).
- Iterate from i = l + 1 to r:
- If `s[l]` is equal to `s[i]`, it means there is a group of consecutive characters that can be deleted if any of them matches.
- Call the find_minimum_deletion function recursively for two substrings:
- From `l + 1 to i - 1`: delete the letters in between `l and i` when both characters are the same.
- From `i to r`: delete the remaining substring after the matched group.
- Calculate the sum of these two recursive calls and update `res` with the minimum value.
- Memoize the result by storing `res` in `dp[l][r]`.
- Return `res`.

2. In the driver code:
- Define the input string `s`.
- Get the length of the string `n`.
- Define the size of the `dp` array as `N` and initialize it with -1 for each element.
- Call the `find_minimum_deletion` function with initial arguments `0` (start index) and `n - 1` (end index), along with `dp` and s as parameters.
- Print the result.
