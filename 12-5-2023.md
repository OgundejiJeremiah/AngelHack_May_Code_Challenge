## Algorithm

1. Define the codebook object that maps characters to their corresponding binary sequences.
2. Define the decode function that takes two parameters: the encoded string to be decoded and the codebook.
3. Inside the decode function, initialize an empty string variable called result to store the decoded string.
4. While the encoded string is not empty, perform the following steps:

a. Iterate through each character symbol in the codebook.
b. Check if the encoded string starts with the binary sequence code[symbol] for the current symbol.
c. If there is a match, append the current symbol to the result string.
d. Remove the matched binary sequence code[symbol] from the beginning of the encoded string by slicing it.
e. Break the loop and continue with the remaining encoded string.
5. Return the result string, which represents the decoded string.
6. Define the encoded string that needs to be decoded.
7. all the decode function with the encoded string and the codebook as arguments.
8. Perform additional string transformations if needed to modify specific substrings in the decoded string.
9. Print or use the final decoded string as desired.

# Decoding Encoded Strings

This code provides a JavaScript implementation to decode an encoded string using a given codebook. It follows a specific encoding scheme where each character in the codebook corresponds to a binary sequence. The code uses the codebook to decode the encoded string and returns the original string.

# Codebook

The codebook is defined as an object where each key represents a character and its corresponding value represents the binary sequence used for encoding. For example:

```
const codebook = {
  'a': '00',
  'b': '01',
  'c': '10',
  // ... other characters
  ' ': '11111111110001'
};
```

# Decoding Algorithm

The decoding algorithm is implemented as the decode function, which takes the encoded string and the codebook as parameters. It iterates over the encoded string and matches the binary sequences with the corresponding characters from the codebook. It constructs the decoded string by appending the decoded characters. The algorithm performs the following steps:

1. Initialize an empty string result to store the decoded string.
2. While the encoded string is not empty:
+ Iterate through each character in the codebook.
+ If the encoded string starts with the binary sequence for the current character:
* Append the current character to the result.
+ Remove the matched binary sequence from the encoded string.
- Break the loop and continue with the remaining encoded string.
3. Return the decoded string.

# Usage

To use this code, you can define an encoded string and a codebook. Then call the decode function with the encoded string and codebook as arguments. The code will return the decoded string.

Example usage:

```
// Define the encoded string
const encodedString = '...'; // The encoded string to be decoded

// Define the codebook
const codebook = {
  'a': '00',
  'b': '01',
  'c': '10',
  // ... other characters
  ' ': '11111111110001'
};

// Decode the encoded string using the codebook
const decodedString = decode(encodedString, codebook);

// Print the decoded string
console.log(decodedString);
```
