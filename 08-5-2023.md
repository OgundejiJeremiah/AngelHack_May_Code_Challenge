# Permutation with Divisibility Check

This program generates all possible permutations of the characters in a given string and finds the largest and smallest numbers that are divisible by 7. It then calculates the average of these two numbers.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript

## Usage

To use the program, simply call the **permute** function and pass in a string as an argument:

```
const result = permute('1867');
console.log(`The average of the largest and smallest permutation is ${result}`);
```
The **permute** function will return the average of the largest and smallest numbers that are divisible by 7.

## Approach

The program first generates all possible permutations of the characters in the input string using a recursive implementation of the Heap's algorithm. Each permutation is then converted to an integer using the **parseInt** method. The resulting array of integers is then filtered to find only those numbers that are divisible by 7. The filtered array is sorted to find the largest and smallest numbers, and their average is calculated.

## Code Structure

The **permute** function is the main function that takes in a string and returns the average of the largest and smallest permutation that is divisible by 7. It calls the **permutate** function to generate all possible permutations of the characters in the string, and then filters and sorts the resulting array of integers to find the required numbers.

The **permutate** function is a recursive function that generates all possible permutations of the characters in an array using Heap's algorithm.

## Conclusion

This program demonstrates a simple way to generate all possible permutations of a string and perform some calculations on the resulting permutations.
